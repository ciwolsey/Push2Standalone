# Push2Standalone

## What is it?
Use your Ableton Push 2 encoders outside of Ableton Live. Allows usage of 8 encoders that can be remapped to 16 others banks using the pads allowing for up to 128 encoders.

## Requirements
You'll need to install the latest dotnet runtime (2.2.300). You'll also need to create a virtual MIDI device named "Push2Standalone" (for this you can use loopMidi (https://www.tobias-erichsen.de/software/loopmidi.html).

## Usage
Run Push2Standalone.exe and you'll see the bottom two rows of your pads light up white. Press a pad to select a bank. The current bank will be highlighted orange.
